# Object Detection and Identification on Webcam
This is a Google Code Collab project, on implementing scaled YOLOv4 (Based on Darknet Neural network) in order to detect and identify different types of object in real time! The database in use is Microsoft's YOLO COCO dataset.




# How to execute the project by yourself
In the github reposatory download the jupyter notebook file. Then upload it in your google drive, and then open the file in google collab where it will run using your GPU power. It is the fastest way to do execute the project. In order to execute the projet on your CPU please inform in the issues section, I'll upload the CPU workthrough in this reposatory itself. 

Thank you.
